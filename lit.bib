  abstract = {{Preface ''The worst thing about new books is thatthey keep us from
	reading the old ones.' '(Joseph Joubert, 1754-1824) A system is correct
	if it meets its design requirements. This much is agreed.But if the
	system we are designing is a piece of software, especially if itinvolves
	concurrency, how can we show this? It is not enough to merely showthat
	a system can meet its requirements. A few tests generally suffice
	todemonstrate that. The real test is to show that a system cannot
	fail to meet itsrequirements. Dijkstra's well-known dictum on testing1
	applies especially to concurrentsoftware: the non-determinism of
	concurrent system executions makes it hardto devise a traditional
	test suite with sufficient coverage. There are fundamentalproblems
	here, related to both the limited controllability of events in distributedsystem
	executions and to the limited observability of those events. A well-designed
	system provably meets its design requirements. But, if wecannot achieve
	this degree of certainty with standard test methods, what elsecan
	we do? Using standard mathematics is not much of an option in thisdomain.
	A thorough hand proof of even simple distributed programs canchallenge
	the most hardened mathematician. At first blush, mechanical proofprocedures
	also do not seem to hold much promise: it was shown long ago that
	it is fundamentally impossible to construct a general proof procedure
	forarbitrary programs.3 So what gives? 1. The quote ''Program testing
	can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to showtheir
	absence'' first appeared in Dijkstra 1972, p. 6. The quote has a
	curious pendant in Dijkstra1965 that is rarely mentioned: ''One can
	never guarantee that a proof is correct, the bestone can say is:
	"I have not discovered any mistakes."'' 2. For instance, process
	scheduling decisions made simultaneously by different processors
	atdistinct locations in a larger network. Fortunately, if some modest
	conditions are met, we can mechanically verifythe correctness of
	distributed systems software. It is the subject of this bookto show
	what these ''modest conditions'' are and how we can use relativelysimple
	tool-based verification techniques to tackle demanding software designproblems.
	LOGIC MODEL CHECKING The method that we will use to check the correctness
	of software designs isstandard in most engineering disciplines. The
	method is called model checking.When the software itself cannot be
	verified exhaustively, we can build asimplified model of the underlying
	design that preserves its essential characteristicsbut that avoids
	known sources of complexity. The design model canoften be verified,
	while the full-scale implementation cannot. Bridge builders and airplane
	designers apply much the same technique whenfaced with complex design
	problems. By building and analyzing models (orprototypes) the risk
	of implementing a subtly flawed design is reduced. It isoften too
	expensive to locate or fix design errors once they hav e reached
	theimplementation phase. The same is true for the design of complex
	software.The modeling techniques that we discuss in this book work
	especially well forconcurrent software, which, as luck will have
	it, is also the most difficult todebug and test with traditional
	means. The models we will build can be seen as little programs, written
	in, what mayat first look like, a strangely abstract language. The
	models that are written inthis language are in fact executable. The
	behaviors they specify can be simulatedand explored exhaustively
	by the model checker in the hunt for logicerrors. Constructing and
	executing these high-level models can be fun andinsightful. It often
	also gives a sufficiently different perspective on a programmingproblem
	that may lead to new solutions, even before any precise checks are
	performed. A logic model checker is designed to use efficient procedures
	for characterizingall possible executions, rather than a small subset,
	as one might see in trialexecutions. Since it can explore all behaviors,
	the model checker can apply arange of sanity checks to the design
	model, and it can successfully identifyunexecutable code, or potentially
	deadlocking concurrent executions. It canev en check for compliance
	with complex user-defined correctness criteria.Model checkers are
	unequalled in their ability to locate subtle bugs in systemdesigns,
	providing far greater control than the more traditional methods basedon
	human inspection, testing, or random simulation. Model checking techniques
	have been applied in large scale industrial applications,to reduce
	the reliance on testing, to detect design flaws early in adesign
	cycle, or to prove their absence in a final design. Some examples
	ofthese applications are discussed in this book. THE SPIN MODEL CHECKER
	The methodology we describe in this book centers on the use of the
	modelchecker SPIN. This verification system was developed at Bell
	Labs in theeighties and nineties and is freely available from the
	Web (see Appendix D).The tool continues to evolve and has over many
	years attracted a fairly broadgroup of users in both academia and
	industry. At the time of writing, SPIN isone of the most widely used
	logic model checkers in the world. In 2002 SPIN was recognized by
	the ACM (the Association for ComputingMachinery) with its most prestigious
	Software System Award. In receivingthis award, SPIN was placed in
	the league of truly breakthrough software systemssuch as UNIX, TeX,
	Smalltalk, Postscript, TCP/IP, and Tcl/Tk. Theaw ard has brought
	a significant amount of additional attention to the tool andits underlying
	technology. With all these developments there has been agrowing need
	for a single authoritative and comprehensive user guide. Thisbook
	is meant to be that guide. The material in this book can be used
	either as classroom material or as aself-study guide for new users
	who want to learn about the background anduse of logic model checking
	techniques. A significant part of the book isdevoted to a comprehensive
	set of reference materials for SPIN that combinesinformation that
	both novice and experienced users can apply on a daily basis. BOOK
	STRUCTURE SPIN can be used to thoroughly check high-level models
	of concurrent systems.This means that we first have to explain how
	one can convenientlymodel the behavior of a concurrent system in
	such a way that SPIN can checkit. Next, we have to show how to define
	correctness properties for the detailedchecks, and how to design
	abstraction methods that can be used to renderseemingly complex verification
	problems tractable. We do all this in the firstpart of this book,
	Chapters 1 to 5. The second part, Chapters 6 to 10, provides a treatment
	of the theory behindsoftware model checking, and a detailed explanation
	of the fundamental algorithmsthat are used in SPIN. The third part
	of the book, Chapters 11 to 15, contains more targeted help ingetting
	started with the practical application of the tool. In this part
	of thebook we discuss the command line interface to SPIN, the graphical
	user interfaceXSPIN, and also a closely related graphical tool that
	can be used for anintuitive specification of correctness properties,
	the Timeline editor. This partis concluded with a discussion of the
	application of SPIN to a range of standardproblems in distributed
	systems design. Chapters 16 to 19, the fourth and last part of the
	book, include a complete setof reference materials for SPIN and its
	input language, information that was sofar only available in scattered
	form in books, tutorials, papers, and Web pages.This part contains
	a full set of manual pages for every language construct andev ery
	tool option available in the most recent versions of SPIN and XSPIN.The
	Web site http://spinroot.com/spin/Doc/Book\_extras/ contains online
	versions of all examples used in this book, some lecture materials,
	and an up to date list of errata. For courses in model checking techniques,
	the material included here can provideboth a thorough understanding
	of the theory of logic model checking andhands-on training with the
	practical application of a well-known model checkingsystem. For a
	more targeted use that is focused directly on the practicalapplication
	of SPIN, the more foundational part of the book can be skipped.A
	first version of this text was used for several courses in formal
	verificationtechniques that I taught at Princeton University in New
	Jersey, at ColumbiaUniversity in New York, and at the Royal Institute
	of Technology in Stockholm,Sweden, in the early nineties. I am most
	grateful to everyone who gavefeedback, caught errors, and made suggestions
	for improvements, as well as toall dedicated SPIN users who have
	graciously done this throughout the years,and who fortunately continue
	to do so. I especially would like to thank Dragan Bosnacki, from
	Eindhoven Universityin The Netherlands, who read multiple drafts
	for this book with an unusuallykeen eye for spotting inconsistencies,
	and intercepting flaws. I would alsolike to thank Al Aho, Rajeev
